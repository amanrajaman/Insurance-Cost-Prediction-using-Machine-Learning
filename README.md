# 🏥 Insurance Cost Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting individual medical insurance costs using demographic and lifestyle data.
It applies exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and machine learning regression models
to estimate insurance charges accurately.

The project demonstrates a complete **data analysis + ML workflow**, suitable for Data Analyst
and entry-level Machine Learning roles.

## 📌 Problem Statement
Medical insurance costs vary significantly based on factors such as age, BMI, smoking habits,
and region. Accurately predicting insurance charges can help insurance companies with pricing
strategies and risk assessment.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze factors influencing insurance charges
- Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis
- Build regression models to predict insurance cost
- Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics

---

## 🗂️ Dataset
- Dataset contains demographic and health-related attributes
- Key features include:
  - Age
  - Sex
  - BMI
  - Number of children
